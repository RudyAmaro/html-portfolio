<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Rudy Amaro, I'm new to web development.  I started my journey at 31 years old the year 2024, it's September now.  
  I bought a web development course in 2020, i ended up quitting after a few modules into the couse.  I doubted myself a lot, 
  it took me sometime to regain some focus and come back with a clear head.  My job puts a big stress in my life, it's a diffcult 
  balance to manage.  I believe that negative mindset held me back to grow as a person and as a developer.  This time around I 
  am not giving up, I'm going to complete this course.

<p>I have an adventours spirit, in my freetime I enjoy being outdoors exploring parks and lakes.  My favorite park so far 
  has been the Olympic State Park in Washington.  Taking my paddle board to the lake is my favorite way to unplug on 
  the weekends.
</p>

<p>My goals for this year are to complete this course.  Create my own website and start building up a portfolio of projects.
Eat healthier, continue to workout daily and be more active.
